Triple Consensus (PoH + PoW + PoS) – 10k+ TPS Target
Overview
Welcome to the XerisCoin Local Alpha Node. This software lets you run a fully isolated, private blockchain on your machine—watching it mine blocks in real-time with our patent-pending triple consensus engine. See Proof-of-History (PoH) slots tick every 400ms, scrypt-based Proof-of-Work (PoW) hashes solve under dynamic difficulty, and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators stake 1000 XRS automatically. No internet, no peers—just pure, verifiable chain growth in your terminal.
Designed for developers, testers, and enthusiasts: Download, run, and witness 10k+ TPS potential locally. Observe slots climb from 1 to 100+ in minutes, hashes grinding nonces, and rewards accruing. This alpha proves the tech is real—before mainnet in Q1 2026.
Platform Support: macOS and Linux (x86_64).
